# Tensorflow Practice

### Description
The Tensorflow Model Prediction creates a model that predicts the accuracy of images using
machine learning (via Tensorflow). This project uses Tensorflow's sample data set/Tensorflow keras, as high level API to build and train models in tensorflow.

We get back the determined accuracy of the prediction, as well as the 'predicted' result and the 'actual' result.


The Tensorflow Text Classification Text decodes integers pointing to words 
to words pointing to integers and determines whether the review is 
good or bad with a limit of 250 words max in a review.

Output results in the original text, encoded review, and a numerical value below whether the model thinks the review is positive or negative.
